# Maturin

`maturin.core` contains an attempt from last July at an API for running
animations of physical systems, powered by a Lagrangian.

`core` contains animators for:

- a triple pendulum!
- a particle moving under uniform gravity
- a particle confined to an ellipse, rendered in 3D
- a "driven" pendulum

### To get this working:

- evaluate `maturin.core`
- go to each `comment` block and evaluate the form inside to trigger an
  animation.

I've added some inline notes on what I was thinking for each piece.
